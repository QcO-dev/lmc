# Little Man Computer

Simulates the [Little Man Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer).

Offers assembly and emulation, with register and memory views.

Can take I/O.

Has both a run mode and a step-through mode.

May contain some bugs and inefficient code, as it was made for a challenge over a day or two.
